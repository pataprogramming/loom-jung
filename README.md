# loom-jung

`loom-jung` provides wrappers for
[`loom`](https://github.com/aysylu/loom) graphs for use with JUNG, the
[Java Universal Network/Graph
Framework](http://jung.sourceforge.net/).  This is particularly useful
for taking advantage of JUNG's Swing-based graph visualization
facilities.

Unfortunately, JUNG has not seen a release since 2010. The
functionality in `loom-jung` is experimental, and is probably best
considered as a proof of concept.

JUNG's API is extremely verbose, and `loom-jung` currently only covers
a few functions. Doing anything significant with this library would
require a fairly deep understanding JUNG.

### Leiningen/Clojars [group-id/name version]

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/pataprogramming/loom-graph/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/pataprogramming/loom-graph)

## Usage

`loom-jung` wraps Loom graphs and JUNG's visualization facilities. The
Swing portions are implemented as extensions
[Seesaw](http://github.com/daveray/seesaw).  At the moment,
`loom-jung` is a proof-of-concept, providing only a few features to
demonstrate basic visualizations.  The API is likely to change
extensively.


To see it in action, start up a REPL from the project directory.
```
% lein repl

> (require '[loom.graph :refer :all])
> (require '[seesaw.core :refer :all])
> (require '[seesaw.color :refer [color]])
> (require '[loom-jung.visualization :refer :all])
> (require '[loom-jung.layout :refer :all])
```

To have something to visualize, we'll need a Loom graph. As we want a
dynamic visualization, we'll store it in an atom.

```
> (def ga (atom (graph [1 2] [2 3] [3 1])))
```

A visualizer is a Swing component. At a minimum, it needs a graph
supplied to it at creation. It expects a loom graph wrapped in something
that can be dereferenced, but will if supplied a bare Loom graph it
will wrap it in an atom.
```
> (def vv (visualizer ga))
```

To see it in action, add it to a Swing JFrame:
```
> (def f (frame))
> (-> f (config! :content vv) pack! show!)
```

When using the default `spring-layout`, changes to nodes and edges
will be reflected immediately.
```
> (swap! ga add-edges [3 4] [4 5] [5 1])
> (swap! ga remove-edges [3 1])
> (swap! ga add-edges [1 6] [2 7] [3 8] [4 9] [5 10])
```

The `visualizer` uses a JUNG `SpringLayout` to position its vertices
unless another layout is specified.  As you will likely see, the graph
tends to drift around the display area. We can tweak things by
directly manipulating the positions of vertices.
```
> (def lo (-> vv .getGraphLayout))
> (lock! lo 1) ; stop the SpringLayout from moving vertex 1
> (location! lo 1 [300 300]) ; set vertex 1's position to (300,300)
```

`spring-layout` doesn't work well for extremely dense graphs, but
sometimes you can improve its behavior by adjusting its parameters.
Here, we create a new layout to use, as the one retrieved from the
visualizer lacks the type information that Seesaw's configuration
mechanism uses to find applicable options. (Note that you must
supply the graph directly to the layout when it's created.)
```
> (def sl (spring-layout ga))
> (config! vv :layout sl)
> (config! sl :force-multiplier 0.2 :stretch 0.3)
> (config! sl :repulsion-range 150)
```

JUNG has extensive facilities for customizing and interacting with the
visualizations. The Java API is extremely verbose. `loom-jung` tries
to simplify this as much as possible. For the currently wrapped API
functions, you should be able to a standard Clojure function anyplace
that a `Transformer` is expected..

For example, to add labels to the vertices:
```
> (config! vv :vertex-label str)
```

Nearly every aspect of the graph is adjustable, though most features
are not yet supported by the `loom-jung` API. Here's an example of
using a function to change node colors::
```
> (config! vv :vertex-fill #(if (even? %) (color "blue") (color "green")))
```

`spring-layout` is used by default, and several other layouts are also
wrapped. For example, to give `circle-layout` a try:
```
> (def cl (circle-layout ga))
> (config! vv :layout cl)
```

`spring-layout` is a dynamic layout that constantly refreshes, so any
changes you make are reflected immediately in the visualization. This
is not the case for most JUNG layouts, which often must be manually
redrawn. Unfortunately, this makes the JUNG visualizations less
immediately useful to most Clojure programmers.

```
> (config! vv :vertex-fill (constantly (color "red")))
> (.repaint vv)  ; Maybe necessary if the visualizer doesn't update automatically.
```

Furthermore, `circle-layout` won't update if the graph changes.
```
> (swap! ga add-edges [11 12] [12 13] [11 13] [11 14])
> (.repaint vv)
```

For now, if you're using a non-dynamic layout like `circle-layout`,
you'll need to create a new layout from scratch when the graph
changes.  (Note that the new vertices show up in the top left corner
after the repaint.)
```
> (config! vv :layout (circle-layout ga))
```

## Supported Properties

The following configuration properties are currently implemented for
the `visualizer`:
```
:layout

:vertex-draw
:vertex-fill
:vertex-font
:vertex-label
:vertex-shape
:vertex-stroke

:edge-draw
:edge-label
:edge-shape
:edge-stroke

:arrow?
:arrow-draw
:arrow-fill
:arrow-stroke

:vertex-renderer
:edge-renderer
```

Making effective use of these requires some knowledge of JUNG.  The
most immediately interesting to play around with are the `:vertex-*`
and `:edge-*` options (except for `:vertex-renderer` and
`:edge-renderer`).  These take a function that expects a vertex or
edge, and returns a `java.awt.*` object of the appropriate type.  Note
that `:arrow?` expects a predicate function that takes an edge and
returns a boolean (`true` indicates that, in a directed graph, an
arrowhead should be drawn). The other `:arrow-*` functions expect a
JUNG `Context` object, and will be more difficult to work with until
the `loom-jung` API is more developed.
