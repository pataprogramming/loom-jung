# loom-jung

`loom-jung` provides wrappers for
[`loom`](https://github.com/aysylu/loom) graphs for use with JUNG, the
[Java Universal Network/Graph
Framework](http://jung.sourceforge.net/).  This is particularly useful
for taking advantage of JUNG's Swing-based graph visualization
facilities.

Unfortunately, JUNG has not seen a release since 2010. The functionality in
`loom-jung` is experimental, and is probably best considered as a useful
adjunct for exploring Loom-based graphs.

## Usage

`loom-jung` wraps Loom graphs and JUNG's visualization facilities. The
Swing portions are implemented as extensions
[Seesaw](http://github.com/daveray/seesaw).  At the moment,
`loom-jung` is a proof-of-concept, providing only a few features to
demonstrate basic visualizations.  The API is likely to change extensively.


To see it in action, start up a REPL from the project directory.
```
% lein repl

> (require [loom-jung.visualization :refer :all])
> (require [loom-jung.layout :refer :all])
```

To have something to visualize, we'll need a Loom graph. As we want a
dynamic visualization, we'll store it in an atom.

```
> (def ga (atom (graph)))
```

Add some nodes and edges to it:
```
user=> (swap! ga add-edges [1 2] [2 3] [3 4] [4 5] [5 1] [1 6] [2 7] [3 8] [4 9] [5 10])
```

A visualizer is a Swing component. At a minimum, it needs a graph supplied to it at creation.
```
> (def vv (visualizer ga))
```

To see it in action, add it to a Swing JFrame:
```
> (def f (frame))
> (-> f (config! :content vv) pack! show!)
```

JUNG has extensive facilities for customizing and interacting with the visualizations. The Java
API is extremely verbose. `loom-jung` tries to simplify this as much as possible. For the
currently wrapped API functions, you should be able to a standard Clojure function anyplace
that a Transformer is expected.

For example, to add labels to the vertics:
```
> (config! vv :vertex-label str)
```

Nearly every aspect of the graph is adjustable, though most features are not yet supported by
the `loom-jung` API. Here's an example of using a function to change node colors::
```
> (config! vv :vertex-fill #(if (even? %) Color/RED Color/BLUE))
```

At the moment, only `spring-layout` (which is used by default) and `circle-layout` are wrapped.
To give `circle-layout` a try:
```
> (def cl (circle-config g))
> (config! vv :layout cl)
```

`spring-layout` is a dynamic layout that constantly refreshes, so any
changes you make should be reflected immediately in the visualization.
For now, most JUNG layouts must be manually refreshed.  (This will improve
as `loom-jung` develops.)
```
> (swap! ga add-edges [11 12] [12 13] [11 13] [11 14])
> (.repaint vv)
> (config! vv :vertex-fill (constantly Color/BLACK))
> (.repaint vv)
```

The following configuration properties are currently implemented for
the `visualizer` (better documentation is forthcoming):
```
:arrow-draw
:arrow-fill
:arrow-stroke
:arrow?
:edge-draw
:edge-label
:edge-renderer
:edge-shape
:edge-stroke
:layout
:vertex-draw
:vertex-fill
:vertex-font
:vertex-label
:vertex-renderer
:vertex-shape
:vertex-stroke
```
